***biblioTECHa*** is a website that gives users their own virtual library card. As a user you will be able to search and add books to your booklist, create reviews, and comment on fellow readers' posts. This application implements the following features:
-  **Authentication.**  Make your own account, all that's needed is your desired username, email, and password.
-   **Posting and Commenting.**  This thread is aggregated onto the side in chronological order.
-   **Calls to the Open Library API**  The [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/read) is an open, editable library catalog, building towards a web page for every book ever published. Read, borrow, and discover more than 3M books for free.   
- **Styled with Bootstrap.**  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
